  PRESENTATION.
  
  First I use BeautifulSoup to collect the Data.Afterwards i clear them  and append the string of
  ",Greeece" in order to have proper API CALLS with the use of geocode and find the latlong.I visualize them on
  the map.Later on i construct Foursquare API calls in order to collect the popular venues on each island.
  However i modified the function with the Calls and i changed the parameters.The radius was increased to
  to 30KM in order to have the full range of the island and the LIMIT was changed to 200 popular venues from 100
  .I used as i said getdummies for the frequency to be found as well as the methods of describe and count values.
  Finally,I clustered the Islands on the map ,But I initialize the algorithm with 10 centroids in order to have 
  better results with more precision.So we have groups from 0 to 9.After the clustering the remaining Islands
  (the ones with lowest cluster label 0 or 1) were shown in a new map.These Islands are "dissimilar" of the
  others in terms of popularity ,so there are suitable for investment since there are still Developing.With
  the results of DATA anlysis you can determine what investment would be profitable on those Islands...
