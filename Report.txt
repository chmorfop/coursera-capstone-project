1.Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.

Introduction/Business Problem:
My project focus mainly on investors,who want to invest in Tourism.I choose Greece and more precisely its Islands of Aegean.If someone wants to invest in tourism and particularly in Greece ,there are limited options such as Hotels,restaurants and beach bars.The aim of my project is to cluster the majority of the islands and isolate the ones 
with the least popularity ,in which is smart move to invest since they are still developing.So to open a restaurant or a hotel in those islands is safe based on the term of Supply and Demand.

2.Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
The Data of the project are from the wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Aegean_Islands) and i retrieved them with the help of the library BeautifulSoup.Later i clear them and assign them properly in order to have proper API calls.

3.Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.

After I managed to get the Data from the Wiki page and found the proper lat and long and construct the DaTAFRAME.Later on with the help of the Foursquare i made a huge dataframe for all the popular venues.On these venues,I used some statistical Data Analysis with the method .describe and the method .countvalues in order to find the correct percentiles and a unique count.As we learned thrugh the course i used K-means,which is an machine-learning algorithm,in order to cluster the Greek Islands and reduce the Diversity..

Results/Conclusion
After the Clustering the results are obvious,I visualized the remaining Islands ,which are Developing and dissimilar from the remaining popular Clustered Islands.
